<b>Abstract:</b> In this document, we lay out a streamlined, detailed and relatively elementary path to the fundamental results of continuous cohomology of the Lie algebra cohomology of smooth vector fields with trivial coefficients, guided by the strategies of Gelfand and Fuks. We make no claim to originality of the results, or exhaustiveness with respect to the literature. Other than filling out unmentioned details and small holes in the proofs from the literature, the main novelty of this paper is the direct construction of the Gelfand-Fuks spectral sequence for diagonal cohomology using elementary techniques from the theory of factorization algebras.
