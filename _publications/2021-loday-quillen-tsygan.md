<b>Abstract:</b> We investigate the well-known Loday-Quillen-Tsygan theorem, which calculates the Lie algebra homology of the general linear algebra gl(A) for an associative algebra A in terms of cyclic homology, and extend the proof to bornological Lie algebra homology of Fréchet and LF-algebras. For Fréchet spaces, this equals continuous Lie algebra homology. To this end we prepare several statements about homological algebra of topological vector spaces, and discuss when the differential of the bornological Hochschild and cyclic complex are topological homomorphisms in the setting of Fréchet algebras. We apply the results to the algebras of smooth functions on a smooth manifold and compactly supported smooth functions on Euclidean space, and construct from a local-to-global principle a Gelfand-Fuks-like spectral sequence which calculates the stable part of bornological Lie algebra homology of nontrivial gauge algebras. This complements results by Maier, Janssens and Wockel.
