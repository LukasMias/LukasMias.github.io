Welcome to my website! I am Lukas Miaskiwskyi, PhD, mathematical physicist by training, and this is my online presence.
After finishing my M.Sc. at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg in 2018, I moved to the Netherlands to start my PhD under supervision of Dr. Bas Janssens, on the topic of cohomology & projective representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of geometric origin – or, in less scary (but still a little scary) terms: the mathematics of symmetries in quantum systems.

Next to mathematics, I am also passionate about <b>computer science</b> and <b>programming</b>. Parallel to my PhD, I have familiarized myself with the theory of <b>algorithms & data structures</b> and have a solid foundation in frameworks, libraries and languages such as Java & JavaFX, Python & NumPy, C, and the basics of web development (Javascript, (S)CSS, HTML).

During my PhD, my research interests included, but were not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Differential & symplectic geometry</li> 
<li>(Infinite-dimensional) Lie groups and Lie algebras</li> 
<li>Homological algebra</li> 
<li>Functional analysis of Fréchet spaces & general topological vector spaces</li> 
</ul>

On the less professional side of things, I am also quite interested in <b>languages</b>, <b>video games</b>, <b>social politics</b>, <b>public infrastructure</b> and <b>internet culture</b>. But these things are better discussed in person!
