Welcome to my website! My name is Lukas Miaskiwskyi, mathematical physicist by training, and this is my online presence.
Originally from Germany, I have moved to the Netherlands in 2018 to start my PhD here under supervision of Bas Janssens, on the topic of cohomology & projective representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of geometric origin â€“ or, in less scary (but still a little scary) terms: the mathematics of symmetries in quantum systems.
