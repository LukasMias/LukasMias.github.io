Welcome to my website! My name is Lukas Miaskiwskyi, mathematical physicist by training, and this is my online presence.
Originally from Germany, I have moved to the Netherlands in 2018 to start my PhD here under supervision of Bas Janssens, on the topic of cohomology & projective representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of geometric origin – or, in less scary (but still a little scary) terms: the mathematics of symmetries in quantum systems. 

My research interests include: <b>Differential & symplectic geometry</b>, <b>(infinite-dimensional) Lie groups and Lie algebras</b>, <b>homological algebra</b> and <b>functional analysis of Fréchet & general topological vector spaces</b>.
