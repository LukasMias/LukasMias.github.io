Welcome to my website! My name is Lukas Miaskiwskyi, mathematical physicist by training, and this is my online presence.
Originally from Germany, I moved to the Netherlands in 2018 to start my PhD here under supervision of Prof. Dr. Bas Janssens, on the topic of cohomology & projective representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of geometric origin – or, in less scary (but still a little scary) terms: the mathematics of symmetries in quantum systems.

Next to mathematics, I am also passionate about <b>computer science</b> and <b>programming</b>. Parallel to by PhD, I have familiarized myself with the theory of <b>algorithms & data structures</b> and have a solid foundation in frameworks and scripting languages such as <b>Java & JavaFX</b>, <b>Python & NumPy</b>, <b>C</b> and basics of web development <b>(Javascript, (S)CSS, HTML)</b>.

During my PhD, my research interests included, but were not limited to:
<ul>
<li><b>Differential & symplectic geometry</b></li> 
<li><b>(Infinite-dimensional) Lie groups and Lie algebras</b></li> 
<li><b>Homological algebra</b></li> 
<li><b>Functional analysis of Fréchet spaces & general topological vector spaces</b></li> 
</ul>

When I leave behind my professional side, I am also quite interested in <b>languages</b>, <b>video games</b>, <b>social politics</b>, <b>public infrastructure</b> and <b>internet culture</b>. But these things are better discussed in person!
