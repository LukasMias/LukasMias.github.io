Welcome to my website! My name is Lukas Miaskiwskyi, mathematical physicist by training, and this is my online presence.
Originally from Germany, I moved to the Netherlands in 2018 to start my PhD here under supervision of Bas Janssens, on the topic of cohomology & projective representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of geometric origin – or, in less scary (but still a little scary) terms: the mathematics of symmetries in quantum systems. 
<hr>
My research interests include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li><b>Differential & symplectic geometry</b></li> 
<li><b>(Infinite-dimensional) Lie groups and Lie algebras</b></li> 
<li><b>Homological algebra</b></li> 
<li><b>Functional analysis of Fréchet spaces & general topological vector spaces</b></li> 
</ul>

When I leave behind my professional side, I am also quite interested in <b>languages</b>, <b>programming</b>, <b>video games</b>, <b>social politics</b>, <b>public infrastructure</b> and <b>internet culture</b>. But these things are better discussed in person!
